# Road Damage Detection

🚗💥 **Road Damage Detection using YOLOv11**

This project aims to detect and classify road surface damage using the YOLOv11 object detection model. The dataset, training scripts, and model implementation are provided to help improve road safety and maintenance efficiency.

## 📌 Features
- 🚧 Detect various types of road damage (e.g., cracks, potholes and patch.)
- ⚡ Real-time detection using YOLOv11
- 📊 Model training and evaluation scripts included
- 🖼️ Dataset preprocessing and augmentation tools
